let __spells=`
these are the spells i have to offer

befriend - Forces friendship with alarming efficiency, unlike Pinkie Pie, who somehow thinks confetti counts as social bonding.  

trust - Lowers their defenses so they tell you everything, unlike Fluttershy, who whispers secrets and still expects you to remember them correctly.  

miss - Leaves a subtle ache when you’re gone, unlike Rainbow Dash, who somehow misses deadlines as much as she misses punctuality.  

invite - Adjusts social logistics so your presence is unavoidable, unlike Rarity, who “forgets” guest lists and calls it elegance.  

lean - Compresses personal space until closeness feels natural, unlike Applejack, who claims “practicality” while elbowing everyone anyway.  

confide - Encourages honesty without prompting, unlike Fluttershy, who somehow overshares and undercommunicates simultaneously.  

prefer - Reorders priorities so you’re noticed first, unlike Spike, who prioritizes literally everything else over basic common sense.  

defend - Activates loyalty instantly, unlike Rainbow Dash, who rushes in first and thinks later—usually about herself.  

recall - Forces memory recall of you, unlike Pinkie Pie, who remembers events that never actually happened.  

return - Makes them come back repeatedly, unlike Starlight Glimmer, whose attempts at “growth” are visible but inconvenient.  

depend - Makes your absence feel wrong, unlike Princess Luna, who dramatically sighs at everyone else’s mistakes but never admits fault.
